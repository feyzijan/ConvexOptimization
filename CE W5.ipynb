For instance, one can look for the best linear interpolator or the best polynomial interpolator. A popular class of interpolators is the class of rational functions, i.e. functions which are the ratio of two polynomials. For instance, this is the case in control engineering, where the measurements are sampled values of the transfer function, called \"moments\", and we aim at obtaining the best transfer function that matches the sampled moments. Of course, transfer functions are rational functions.\n","\n","Consider the following **quasiconvex** optimisation problem:\n","$$\n","\\begin{array}{ll}\n","\\min & \\displaystyle \\max_{i=1,\\dots,k} \\left| \\frac{p(t_i)}{q(t_i)}-y_i\\right| \n","\\end{array} \\tag{1}\n","$$\n","with\n","$$\n","p(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2 + \\cdots + a_m t^m, \\qquad q(t) = 1 + b_1t + \\cdots + b_n t^n,\n","$$\n","where the domain of the objective function is\n","$$\n","D = \\{(a,b)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}\\times \\mathbb{R}^n : q(t) > 0, \\,\\,\\alpha \\le t \\le \\beta \\}.\n","$$\n","In this problem we fit a rational function $p(t)/q(t)$ to given data $y$, while constraining the polynomial denominator to be positive in the interval $[\\alpha,\\beta]$.
