This is called an *impression*. We divide some time interval (say, one day) into $T$ periods, labeled $t = 1,\\dots,T$. Let $N_{it} \\ge 0$ denote the number of impressions in period $t$ for which we display ad $i$. In period $t$ there will be a total of $I_t >0$ impressions, so we must have $\\sum_{i=1}^n N_{it} = I_t$, for $t=1,\\dots,T$ (these numbers are known from past history). You can treat all these numbers as real (this is justified since they are typically very large).\n","\n","The revenue for displaying ad $i$ in period $t$ is $R_{it} \\ge 0$ per impression (this might come from click-through payments, for example). The total revenue is $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\sum_{i=1}^n R_{it}N_{it}$. To maximize revenue, we would simply display the ad with the highest revenue per impression, and no other, in each display period."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xJZpFDHHdliP"},"source":["But our problem is more complicated. We also have in place a set of $m$ contracts that require us to display certain numbers of ads, or mixes of ads (say, associated with the products of one company), over certain periods, with a penalty for any shortfalls. Contract $j$ is characterized by a set of ads $\\mathcal{A}_j \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, a set of periods $\\mathcal{T}_j \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$, a target number of impressions $q_j \\ge 0$, and a shortfall penalty rate $p_j >0$.\n","\n","The *shortfall* for contract $j$ is\n","\n","$$\n","s_j = \\left(q_j - \\sum_{t\\in \\mathcal{T}_j} \\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}_j} N_{it} \\right)_+,\n","$$\n","\n","where $(u)_+$ means $\\max\\{u,0\\}$.
